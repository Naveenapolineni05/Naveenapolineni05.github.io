### Project : Food Calorie Tracker
* Developed a React-based food calorie tracking application that allows users to log meals and view daily 
and weekly calorie totals.
* Built reusable React components to manage meal entries, calorie displays, and progress views using 
component state and props.
* Implemented client-side logic to calculate calorie totals and support goal tracking without a backend service.
* Designed data visualizations to display calorie trends and progress using chart components.
* Applied responsive styling and layout techniques to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
