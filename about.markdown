I recently completed LaunchCode’s software development program, where I built projects using Java, React, JavaScript, HTML,
Spring, Spring boot and CSS. 
I have experience analyzing systems, troubleshooting issues, and working in collaborative environments. 
My previous experience in support and system analysis taught me problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills, 
which I now bring to software development. 
I enjoy creating clean, responsive user interfaces and building backend logic with Java to support application functionality.
